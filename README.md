# bclindner's dotfiles

if you're here and you're not me, you *probably* have no reason to be here.
but anyways, these are my dotfiles. these dotfiles contain my configurations for:

* i3-gaps
* i3status
* nano
* screen
* bash

i basically just keep them here so i don't screw up my configurations when i reinstall (aka when i screw 
up really really badly such that it's not worth fixing). also to figure out how to use git because 
apparently i have to learn some sort of vcs to develop collaboratively. have fun looking through them, i 
guess?

**NOTE:** i3-gaps is REQUIRED for the i3 config to work.
