# bclindner's dotfiles

if you're here and you're not me, you *probably* have no reason to be here.
but anyways, these are my dotfiles. these dotfiles contain my configurations for:

* i3
* i3status

i basically just keep them here so i don't screw up my configurations when i reinstall (aka when i screw 
up really really badly such that it's not worth fixing). have fun looking through them, i guess?
